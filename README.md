A simple Java currency converter. Only supports a limited amount of currencies, because this is more of a prototype. More currencies can be added pretty easily. (Also I made this while being very tired, so the code is pretty ugly, but the concept works. Feel free to improve the code.)

This project was created for testing and learning purposes. Feel free to use this as guidance if you want to create something similar.
